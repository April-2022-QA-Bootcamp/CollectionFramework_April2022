package CollectionFramework;

/*
It implements List interface in collection framework
It uses a doubly linked list internally to store the elements. 
It can store the duplicate elements. 
It maintains the insertion order 
not synchronized. 
In LinkedList, the manipulation is fast because no shifting is required.
Some Commonly used methods 
addFirst() getFirst() (not in arraylist
addLast()  getLast() (not in arraylist
get(0)🡪specific value 
set(2,”Rahman”)—to set(replace) specific index value
removeFirst()
removeLast()

Show by debuging how elements stores fast(next, prev) and last(next, prev)
*doesnt have capacity
We can print by using: advance for loop, iterator, while loop
